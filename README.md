## Features

- Support for 3 widely used authorization methods.
- Response preprocessor callback support.
- Provides statistics such as time taken for the request to complete.
- Support for Custom Requests / Authorization systems.
- Request Synchronization using lock objects
- Nullable support.
- And many more!

## Usage

You can use this library just like any other Dart package.

- Add `wordpress_client` as a dependency on `pubspec.yaml` file on your project root. At the time of this writing, the latest package version is 6.3.3. Do check [Package Page](https://pub.dev/packages/wordpress_client) to get latest version.

```dart
dependencies:
  wordpress_client: ^7.0.0
```

- Import the library to your project class in which you want to use the library.
  Also, it is to note that imports are split between multiple files, this helps to keep Dart auto-completion less cluttered. i.e., All request classes are seperated into another file, same goes for responses. You can utilize Intellisense to import them easily.

```dart
import 'package:wordpress_client/wordpress_client.dart';
```

- Initializing the client can be done in two ways. It is recommended to initialize `WordpressClient` once and assign the instance to a variable for later use. State of the properties are stored only in that particular instance of the client.

  - Simple method, Initialize with default values.
  - Advanced method (with Bootstrapper to configure various settings like User Agent, Authorization etc)

### Simple method

```dart
WordpressClient client = new WordpressClient.initialize('https://www.replaceme.com/', 'wp-json/wp/v2');
```

You can read about advanced method in [Advanced Method](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/wordpress_client/wiki/Usage#advanced-method) wiki page.

- Now you are ready to send requests to Wordpress REST API. For example, to send request to get the latest 20 posts from your Wordpress site in Ascending order, you can use the following code.:

```dart
WordpressResponse<List<Post>?> postsResponse = await client.posts.list(
    WordpressRequest(
      requestData: ListPostRequest()
        ..page = 1
        ..perPage = 20
        ..order = Order.asc,
    ),
  );
```

`WordpressResponse` is a class which wraps around the actual result object. It also provides access to statistical data related to the response such as the time taken for the request to complete, status codes, Total number of pages etc.

You can access the response object by calling `postsResponse.data`. It will be null if the request failed or if the library failed to parse the response.

## Supported Authorization methods

This library has 3 authorization methods currently supported:

- **BasicAuth** - [Basic Auth](https://github.com/WP-API/Basic-Auth) by The Wordpress Team
- **BasicJwtAuth** - [Basic JWT Authentication](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/) by Enrique Chavez
- **UsefulJwtAuth** - [Useful JWT Authentication](https://github.com/usefulteam/jwt-auth) by Useful Team

For Custom Authorization implementation, Check out [Authorization](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/wordpress_client/wiki/Authorization#custom-authorization) wiki page.
